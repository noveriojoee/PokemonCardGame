# Pokemon Games

hi, here i'm writing code using Pokemon api search to Search pokemon cards,
i'm writing the code using MVVM pattern here..


###Supported features.
1. You supposed to be able using xcode emulator for this one :D means you can also using any iphone with ios 12.1 as the latest

###Supported features.
1. Show List Card using Searcy by name of pokemon name you might know
2. See card details, showing attacks, HP, flavour.. and other cards link with the same type with what you choose
3. Enalarge Card Image in Detail
4. Unit testing with XCTestCase script also inside the project code as well.

###Requirements to build the app
1. Please use xcode 11 above :( (i'm using xcode 12.4, and swift 5.. haven't uprgade my xcode yet)
2. Make sure you download all of it, and open the PokemonGames.xcworkspace there will be linked project to uiComponentsProject as well 


###to start compile and running this project
please just clone this repostitory with this link : 
1. go into project directory "PokemonGames/" and start download the cocoapods with "pod install"
2. go into project directory "UIComponents/" and start download the cocoapods with "pod install"
3. and start the project "command + R" :D, targeted to Pokemongames Scheme
5. i dont do git commit due to restriction

also download the uiComponent framework in here, i made this to demonstrate a little bit about micro front end as well
https://github.com/noveriojoee/UIComponents.git

pardon i'm using objective-c for this one since i was spending a lot of time there than swift...

because i'm also practicing a little bit micro-frontend kind of things, so i start to seperate a dependencies module for a long term use, so the UIComponents its so called a UI Clothes for the apps. it controll the UI Behavior and components
and the PokemonGames is the app itself.


thanks

:D
